# Election Audit Project Overview:

This project requires aiding a mock Colorado Board of Elections Employee, Tom, in an election audit of the tabulated results for US Congressional precinct in Colorado.  As the team-member, I am tasked with with:
1) reporting the total number of votes cast
2) the total number of votes for each candidate
3) the percentage of votes for each candidate
4) the winner of the election based on the popular vote

While historically, this tabulation has occured in excel, the election management wants to automate the process using Python for this election and re-use the code for future elections, to include senatorial districts and local elections.  The key goal is to generate a vote count report to certify the U.S. Congressional race.
