# Election Audit Project Overview:

This project requires aiding a mock Colorado Board of Elections Employee, Tom, in an election audit of the tabulated results for US Congressional precinct in Colorado.  As the team-member, I am tasked with with:
1) reporting the total number of votes cast
2) the total number of votes for each candidate
3) the percentage of votes for each candidate
4) the winner of the election based on the popular vote

While historically, this tabulation has occured in excel, the election management wants to automate the process using Python for this election and re-use the code for future elections, to include senatorial districts and local elections.  The key goal is to general a vote count report to certify the U.S. Congressional race.  

## Total Number of Votes casted in the Congressional Elections


## Breakdown of the number of votes & the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

## County Results by County votes casted

## Candidate Vote Breakdown

  Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
  
 ## Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes? 
 
 
# Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
