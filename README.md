# Election Audit Project Overview:

This project requires aiding a mock Colorado Board of Elections Employee, Tom, in an election audit of the tabulated results for US Congressional precinct in Colorado.  As the team-member, I am tasked with with:
1) reporting the total number of votes cast
2) the total number of votes for each candidate
3) the percentage of votes for each candidate
4) the winner of the election based on the popular vote

While historically, this tabulation has occured in excel, the election management wants to automate the process using Python for this election and re-use the code for future elections, to include senatorial districts and local elections.  The key goal is to generate a vote count report to certify the U.S. Congressional race.  

# Election Results Summary

The audit showed that a total of **360,711** votes were casted in the Congressional Election.

The following table view is a breakdown of the number of votes & the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct:

| County        | Votes Casted  | % of Total Votes |
| ------------- | ------------- | -----------------|
| Denver        | 306,055       | 82.8%            |
| Jefferson     | 38,855        | 10.5%            |
| Arapahoe      | 24,801        | 6.7%             |

Denver county was the county with the largest voter turnout by far taking over 80% of the vote.  Jefferson and Arapahoe struggled with voter turnout, both accounting for the rest of 17.2% of the voter turnout.

# Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
